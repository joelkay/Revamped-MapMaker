Its the technique pain uses on his rain nin to keep them from leaking information. he basically seals away their knowledge of what they do. so I think this can be applied to combat. like if an opponent is stunned (koed even?) you can if 1 tile away lock away their most used jutsu? or lock away their top 3? the skill would go on c/d or disappear for a number of seconds = to your int including boost?
